## Issue Summary
**Duration**: The outage occurred from June 1, 2024, 14:30 UTC to June 1, 2024, 17:00 UTC.

**Impact**: The e-commerce platform experienced significant downtime, resulting in 85% of users being unable to access the website or complete transactions. Users encountered 502 Bad Gateway errors, causing frustration and potential revenue loss.

**Root Cause**: The root cause was a misconfigured Nginx server after a routine update, leading to failed connections between the load balancer and the application servers.

## Timeline

- **14:30 UTC**: Issue detected via monitoring alert indicating a spike in 502 errors.
- **14:32 UTC**: Initial investigation started by the on-call engineer, focusing on the application servers.
- **14:45 UTC**: Noticed high CPU usage on application servers, suspected application-level bug.
- **15:00 UTC**: Rolled back recent application updates, but the issue persisted.
- **15:15 UTC**: Escalated to the network operations team to check for network-related issues.
- **15:30 UTC**: Network team identified misconfiguration in Nginx settings after a recent update.
- **16:00 UTC**: Misleading assumption that it was a network routing issue led to further delays.
- **16:30 UTC**: Correct configuration identified and updated in Nginx.
- **17:00 UTC**: Services fully restored and 502 errors resolved.

## Root Cause and Resolution
**Root Cause**: The Nginx server configuration file was inadvertently altered during a routine update, causing improper load balancing and resulting in 502 Bad Gateway errors. The specific misconfiguration involved incorrect upstream server directives, leading to failed connections between the load balancer and the application servers.

**Resolution**: The network operations team corrected the Nginx configuration file by reverting to the previous working configuration. The team then tested the connections between the load balancer and the application servers, ensuring proper communication before redeploying the updated configuration.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements and Fixes**:
- Enhance the deployment process to include automated configuration validation.
- Implement more robust monitoring and alerting for configuration changes.
- Improve documentation and training around server configuration updates.

**Tasks**:
1. **Patch Nginx server**: Ensure the latest patches and updates are applied while maintaining correct configurations.
2. **Add monitoring on server configurations**: Implement tools to monitor and alert on configuration changes, such as Tripwire or similar.
3. **Automate configuration validation**: Use tools like Chef, Puppet, or Ansible to automate configuration management and validation.
4. **Enhance rollback procedures**: Develop more efficient rollback procedures for configurations, including automated rollback scripts.
5. **Conduct training sessions**: Provide regular training for engineers on best practices for updating and managing server configurations.
6. **Review and update documentation**: Ensure all server configuration and deployment procedures are well-documented and up-to-date.

By implementing these measures, we aim to prevent similar outages in the future and improve the reliability and stability of our e-commerce platform.
